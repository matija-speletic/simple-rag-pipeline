    "answer":{
        "0":"Anterior open bite is defined as a condition where the upper incisor crowns fail to overlap the incisal third of the lower incisor crowns when the mandible is brought into full occlusion. Some causes of anterior open bite include hereditary or non-hereditary factors acting pre- or post-natally on the orofacial tissues, habits like thumb sucking, and certain dental anomalies like ankylosed teeth.",
        "1":"The morphology of the maxillary arch in anterior open bite can show characteristic features related to the etiology. For example, if the malocclusion is due to a habit like thumb sucking, the upper incisor teeth may be proclined, resulting in a V-shaped upper arch. Additionally, increased buccal pressure during sucking can lead to a narrowing of the arch in the molar region.",
        "2":"Some conventional orthodontic treatments for correcting anterior open bite include bite blocks, high-pull headgear, new facemask designs, fixed mechanics, multiloop edgewise archwires, extraction therapy, intermaxillary vertical elastics, and inhibition of molar eruption during growth.",
        "3":"The effectiveness of the treatment for anterior open bite will be assessed in the study by using paired t-test to evaluate the treatment outcome of anterior open bite through temporary anchorage devices (TADs).",
        "4":"The specific technique employed in the treatment plan outlined in the report involves using temporary anchorage devices (TADs) to intrude the maxillary posterior teeth, allowing for auto-rotation of the mandible to close the anterior open bite.",
        "5":"The distinguishing clinical features of CMT4J include childhood onset gait abnormalities, balance difficulties, rapid progression to muscle weakness and atrophy, often mimicking acquired neuropathies. Unlike CIDP and Guillain-Barre Syndrome, CMT4J typically presents with minimal sensory symptoms, asymmetric involvement, and sparing of bulbar and cranial nerve functions. Additionally, CMT4J is characterized by a genetic basis with biallelic pathogenic variants in the FIG4 gene, setting it apart from other neuropathies.",
        "6":"The proposed natural history and outcome measure discovery study of CMT4J aims to enhance understanding of the disease's progression by investigating its clinical characteristics over time. This study will collect standardized clinical data to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, clinical course, and identify potential outcome measures for future clinical trials. By following subjects longitudinally, the study intends to provide insights into the natural history of CMT4J, explore genotype-phenotype correlations, and evaluate candidate outcome measures related to motor function, quality of life, radiology, and electrophysiology. This information can help expedite research and access to new therapies for rare conditions like CMT4J.",
        "7":"Natural history studies are essential for rare diseases like CMT4J to understand the disease progression, clinical characteristics, and outcome measures over time. This knowledge is crucial for developing and evaluating potential therapeutic interventions, including gene transfer therapy. By providing insights into the natural course of the disease, these studies help in designing effective clinical trials and assessing the long-term impact of treatments.",
        "8":"The objectives of the CMT4J natural history study align with broader rare disease research and therapeutic development goals by providing crucial insights into the clinical characteristics, progression, and potential outcome measures for a rare condition. Understanding the natural history of CMT4J can inform future therapeutic interventions, including gene transfer therapy, and contribute to the development of targeted treatments for rare diseases.",
        "9":"Flow cytometry was used to confirm the mature dendritic cells' CD14-, CD36low, and CD83high phenotype characteristics. The mature dendritic cells were washed twice and resuspended in sterile saline. All cell manipulation procedures for vaccine production were performed under GMP conditions. Additionally, melanoma cell lines were established and maintained under strict sterile conditions for vaccine preparation.",
        "10":"Several challenges must be addressed to enhance the effectiveness of cellular vaccine-based immunotherapy. These include overcoming immunosuppression in patients, considering the heterogeneity of antigenic expression in tumors, addressing tumor evasion of immune system recognition, and establishing optimal clinical protocols to maximize the potential of vaccine-based immunotherapy.",
        "11":"The proposed optimization of the Vaccination of Melanoma Patients clinical protocol aims to improve the efficacy of dendritic cell vaccines by alternating dendritic cell vaccines with the use of low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2) as a complement to strengthen the immune system. This approach leverages the benefits of both dendritic cell vaccines and low-dose IL-2 to enhance the immune response against melanoma cells.",
        "12":"Before and after the Multi Joint Isokinetic Training treatment, the evaluation methods employed included photographic evaluation by an independent, blinded reviewer for correct identification of pre-treatment baseline images compared to post-treatment images. Parameters assessed included global aesthetic improvement grading by an expert clinician, improvement of muscle strength measured by a dynamometer, reduction in core circumference measured by Seca Circumferential System, and subject satisfaction using a Satisfaction Survey. Safety endpoints included the subject's assessment of discomfort on a 0-10 numeric rating scale and monitoring of treatment-related adverse events.",
        "13":"The specific indications for use of the Accufit Electrical Muscle Stimulation device mentioned in the clinical trial protocol include muscle relaxation, muscle re-education, pain reduction, and increased local blood circulation. The device achieves its intended effects by generating current flow through the muscles using two-channel stimulation with up to 8 electrodes and waveforms of interferential and biphasic for muscle activation.",
        "14":"The clinical trial protocol plans to mitigate risks associated with muscle electrical stimulation treatment by having an experienced investigator oversee the study, providing training on device use, incorporating safety mechanisms in the device design, rigorous screening of patients before enrollment, and closely monitoring patients throughout the study. Additionally, acute responses like transient tenderness and skin burns will be observed and recorded by the study exposure clinician, with procedures in place to address any serious adverse events promptly.",
        "15":"The contraindications outlined in the clinical trial protocol for the Accufit Electrical Muscle Stimulation device include avoiding use on the pectoral area, patients with cardiac pacemakers, implanted defibrillators, or other metallic\/electronic devices, undiagnosed pain syndromes, direct irradiation of the eyes, and ischemic tissues in individuals with vascular disease. Failure to adhere to these contraindications could lead to potential complications such as skin burns, hyperpigmentation, hypopigmentation, blisters, changes in skin laxity, and other adverse events related to the treatment.",
        "16":"The objective of the \"Postprandial Ambulation in Gestational Diabetes\" trial is to assess the effect of postprandial ambulation on birth weight in patients with gestational diabetes compared to routine activity. The trial aims to address the challenges associated with gestational diabetes by investigating whether postprandial ambulation can help decrease birth weight percentile in neonates of mothers with gestational diabetes.",
        "17":"The \"Postprandial Ambulation in Gestational Diabetes\" trial is a randomized controlled trial that aims to assess the effect of postprandial ambulation on birth weight in patients with gestational diabetes. The key components of its methodology include enrolling patients diagnosed with gestational diabetes, randomizing them into two groups (intervention and non-intervention), having the intervention group walk for 20 minutes after meals, and comparing the birth weight percentiles between the two groups. Randomization occurs via computer-generated blocks of 10, and the study design involves monitoring for any accidents that could occur during the intervention. Participants are assigned a study ID for data collection, and the study is considered minimal risk due to the low-intensity nature of the recommended activity (walking). Participants can voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time, and references supporting the study's rationale are provided.",
        "18":"The \"Postprandial Ambulation in Gestational Diabetes\" trial ensures data reliability and validity by assigning study IDs to participants, linking de-identified data to a study key with identifiable information stored securely, and using REDCap for data collection. The study follows standard clinical care practices by monitoring for any accidents, allowing voluntary withdrawal of participants, and emphasizing that the quality of medical care will not be affected if participants decline to participate.",
        "19":"The national variation in day-case rates for TURBT, TURP, and TUEP surgeries across different hospitals in England can impact patient access and experience. Hospitals with higher day-case rates may offer patients the opportunity to recover at home, potentially leading to cost savings, reduced waiting times, and a more standardized patient experience. However, hospitals with lower day-case rates may result in patients having to stay overnight, potentially affecting their recovery, hospital resources, and overall experience. The variation in day-case rates can influence the availability of resources, waiting times, and the quality of care provided to patients undergoing these surgeries.",
        "20":"The observed trends of increasing day-case rates for TURBT, TURP, and TUEP surgeries in England over the past five years are influenced by recommendations from the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) program. The GIRFT urology program advocates for increased day-case rates for these surgeries, promoting a \"day-case by default\" approach. Additionally, the focus on improving standards, decreasing unwarranted variation in clinical care, and the potential cost savings and environmental benefits associated with day-case surgeries contribute to the trend.",
        "21":"Qualitative research on patient experiences following day-case TURBT, TURP, and TUEP surgeries can provide valuable insights into factors that positively or negatively affect the patient experience. This information can inform future GIRFT recommendations and healthcare policies by identifying areas for improvement in day-case surgery pathways, enhancing patient satisfaction, optimizing resource utilization, and promoting standardized, patient-centered care."

            "1 \n Introduction  \n \n           Anterior open bite may be defined as: That condition where the upper \nincisor crowns fail to overlap the incisal third of the lower incisor crowns when the \nmandible is brought into full occlusion. Within the limits of this definition, the \ndegree or severity of malocclusion may vary from a mild edge to edge relationship \nof the incisor teeth to a severe and handicapping malocclusion(1). \n \n            This type of malocclusion like any other malocclusion is the result of \ncertain causes either of hereditary or non -hereditary origin that act pre - or post -\nnatally on the tissues of the orofacial region. Few malocclusions have a single \nspecific cause. more often they are the result of a combination of many factors \noperating within the inherent predetermined growth potential of each individual \npatient(2). \n \n             Morphology of Dental Open Bite : the shape of the maxillary arch will \nshow characteristic features related to the etiology . If the malocclusion is due to a \nforeign body (pencil, pipe) being held passively between the incisor teeth, then the \nopen bite is localized to the particular teeth involved; they will fail to erupt to the \nocclusal level of the other teeth in the arch.  \n \n               The same clinical appearance is evident in cases having ankylosed upper \nor lower incisor teeth. When the malocclusion is as a result of a thumb sucking \nhabit, then the upper incisor teeth may be proclined resulting in a V -shaped upper\n\nSOURCE: Evaluation Treatment Outcomes of Anterior Open Bite Treated with Maxillary Intrusive Force by Temporary Anchorage Devices..pdf"

CMT can affect both females and males of all ethnicities.  \n \nCMT is classified according to the type of nerve damage (demyelinating vs. axonal) and its type of \ninheritance (autosomal recessive, dominant or X -linked). Mutations in more than 80 genes cause CMT. \nMost of the CMT ne uropathies are demyelinating, especially CMT1A which comprises 60  to 65% of \ncases.  \n \nCMT4J is a rare autosomal recessive, peripheral motor demyelinating neuropathy caused by biallelic \npathogenic variants in the FIG4 gene. CMT4J is characterized by childhood  onset gait abnormalities \nand balance difficulties, that rapidly progress to muscle weakness and muscle atrophy during the teen \nor adult years. Onset can be acute or sub -acute, mimicking an acquired neuropathy and often \nmisdiagnosed as chronic inflammatory  demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), or a subacute \npresentation of Guillain -Barre Syndrome. Involvement can be asymmetric and can affect distal as well \nas proximal musculature. Although sensory symptoms are minimal, examination may reveal decreased \nrespon se to touch, pin prick, or vibration distally. Bulbar and cranial nerve functions are often spared; \nintellect is often normal.  \n \nThis study is designed to investigate the clinical characteristics and natural history of CMT4J. We aim \nto follow subjects with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of CMT4J longitudinally to collect \nstandardized clinical data to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, clinical course, and to identify \npotential outcome measures which may be used in future clinical trials. Clinical d ata collection will \ninclude medical history and physical exam, hematology and biochemical analyses, calf muscle imaging, \nnerve conduction studies, pulmonary function testing and neuropsychological assessments.  \n \nThe study will be conducted in accordance wit h the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and the \napplicable regulatory requirements.  \n \n1.2 Background and Rationale  \n \nThere is no causative treatment available for CMT, but therapeutic clinical trials for the most common \ntypes of CMT, like CMT1A, are ongoin g. Most recently, animal models have demonstrated the \npossibility of treating some types of CMT, like CMT4J, with gene transfer therapy through viral \nvectors. To be able to understand the condition over time and evaluate these therapies at long term, \nnatur al history studies are indispensable. This study investigates the natural history of CMT4J.  \n \n1.3 Concise Summary of Project  \n \nThis is a multicenter, longitudinal, prospective observational natural history study of subjects with a \nmolecularly confirmed diagnosis of CMT4J. We plan to enroll 20 subjects of any age into a uniform \nprotocol for follow -up and evaluations. We will obtain  demographic and medical history information. \nNatural history data will be collected prospectively on an annual basis and may include \nphysical\/neurological exams, standard laboratory tests, CMT outcome and disability measures, \nneuropsychological tests, ner ve conduction studies (NCS), and imaging studies (muscle MRI). \nPulmonary function test (PFT) and scoliosis series x -ray Subject visits will occur every 12 months\n\nSOURCE: A Prospective Natural History and Outcome Measure Discovery Study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 4J.pdf",

We will also collect time of \nsymptoms onset (e.g. , motor, language, etc.) and progression, age at diagnosis and genetic results.  \n \nPhysical and Neurological Examination : At each visit, a physical exam will be recorded including  but \nnot limited to evaluation of the ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, back, and extremities, motor \nand sensory, and vital signs which will include blood pressure (measured in one arm or, if necessary, \none leg, after the subject has been seated f or approximately 5 minutes), pulse, temperature, height, \nweight, and head circumference.  \n \nA detailed neurological examination including but not limited to evaluation of cranial nerves, muscle \ntone, muscle strength, sensation, gait, coordination and deep te ndon reflex testing will also be \nperformed. Handheld dynamometry will also be performed during clinic visits in muscles of the upper \nand lower extremities. The examination is anticipated to take approximately 30 minutes.  \n \n3.1 Outcome Measures  \nCMT  Pediatric Sca le (CMT PedS ): The CMTPedS is a clinical tool used to supplement a neurological \nexamination and capture functionally relevant limitations caused by CMT in the pediatric population. \nIt is intended to have broad application in natural history studies and clin ical trials of rehabilitative \n(e.g., orthoses, stretching, strengthening), pharmacological (e.g. , curcumin, anti -progesterone) and \nsurgical (e.g. , foot and hand tendon transfer, arthrodesis, hip dysplasia) interventions (3). This scale \nwill be used for sub jects aged 5 to 17 years 11 months (less than 18 years).  \n \nCMT Infant Scale (CMTInfS) : The CMTInfS is a validated clinical tool and r equires 20 min to \nadminister and is a reliable and sensitive 15 -item functional outcome measure for early onset CMT and \nrelated neuropathies. The CMTInfS can be implemented in natural history studies to understand the \nrate of progression at the earliest stages of disease in preparation for therapeutic trials of early \ninterventions . The CMTPedS involves some difficult items that require advanced levels of \ncomprehension, so high variability is seen in children <4 years of age. Therefore, for children aged 3 \nyears, the CMTInfS may be more sensitive to disease severity and clinical impression.  \n \nCMT  Neuropathy Score, second versi on (CMT NSv2 ): The CMTNSv2 is a validated clinical outcome \nmeasure developed for use in clinical trials to monitor disease impairment, severity and progression in \naffected CMT subjects (4). This scale will be used for subjects 18 years of age or older.  \n \nCMT  Functional Outcome Measure (CMT -FOM ): The CMT -FOM is a performance -based outcome \nassessment which measures limitations in functional abilities in adults with CMT1A  (5). It was based \non the validated CMTPedS and further developed using review of the litera ture, patient interviews and \na survey of 407 adults with CMT, and subjects 18 years of age or older.  \n \nCMT Health Index (CMTHI) : The CMTHI is a disease -specific, patient reported outcome measure \ndesigned to capture the disease burden of inherited neuropathies, in the context of a clinical trial (6). \nThis scale will be used for subjects 18 years of age or older.  \n \nVineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, 3rd Edition : The caregiver interview form will be used to evaluate \ncommunication, socialization, and dai ly living skills of subjects to assess their overall adaptive\n\nSOURCE: A Prospective Natural History and Outcome Measure Discovery Study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 4J.pdf",

CMT can affect both females and males of all ethnicities.  \n \nCMT is classified according to the type of nerve damage (demyelinating vs. axonal) and its type of \ninheritance (autosomal recessive, dominant or X -linked). Mutations in more than 80 genes cause CMT. \nMost of the CMT ne uropathies are demyelinating, especially CMT1A which comprises 60  to 65% of \ncases.  \n \nCMT4J is a rare autosomal recessive, peripheral motor demyelinating neuropathy caused by biallelic \npathogenic variants in the FIG4 gene. CMT4J is characterized by childhood  onset gait abnormalities \nand balance difficulties, that rapidly progress to muscle weakness and muscle atrophy during the teen \nor adult years. Onset can be acute or sub -acute, mimicking an acquired neuropathy and often \nmisdiagnosed as chronic inflammatory  demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), or a subacute \npresentation of Guillain -Barre Syndrome. Involvement can be asymmetric and can affect distal as well \nas proximal musculature. Although sensory symptoms are minimal, examination may reveal decreased \nrespon se to touch, pin prick, or vibration distally. Bulbar and cranial nerve functions are often spared; \nintellect is often normal.  \n \nThis study is designed to investigate the clinical characteristics and natural history of CMT4J. We aim \nto follow subjects with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of CMT4J longitudinally to collect \nstandardized clinical data to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, clinical course, and to identify \npotential outcome measures which may be used in future clinical trials. Clinical d ata collection will \ninclude medical history and physical exam, hematology and biochemical analyses, calf muscle imaging, \nnerve conduction studies, pulmonary function testing and neuropsychological assessments.  \n \nThe study will be conducted in accordance wit h the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and the \napplicable regulatory requirements.  \n \n1.2 Background and Rationale  \n \nThere is no causative treatment available for CMT, but therapeutic clinical trials for the most common \ntypes of CMT, like CMT1A, are ongoin g. Most recently, animal models have demonstrated the \npossibility of treating some types of CMT, like CMT4J, with gene transfer therapy through viral \nvectors. To be able to understand the condition over time and evaluate these therapies at long term, \nnatur al history studies are indispensable. This study investigates the natural history of CMT4J.  \n \n1.3 Concise Summary of Project  \n \nThis is a multicenter, longitudinal, prospective observational natural history study of subjects with a \nmolecularly confirmed diagnosis of CMT4J. We plan to enroll 20 subjects of any age into a uniform \nprotocol for follow -up and evaluations. We will obtain  demographic and medical history information. \nNatural history data will be collected prospectively on an annual basis and may include \nphysical\/neurological exams, standard laboratory tests, CMT outcome and disability measures, \nneuropsychological tests, ner ve conduction studies (NCS), and imaging studies (muscle MRI). \nPulmonary function test (PFT) and scoliosis series x -ray Subject visits will occur every 12 months\n\nSOURCE: A Prospective Natural History and Outcome Measure Discovery Study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 4J.pdf",

CMT can affect both females and males of all ethnicities.  \n \nCMT is classified according to the type of nerve damage (demyelinating vs. axonal) and its type of \ninheritance (autosomal recessive, dominant or X -linked). Mutations in more than 80 genes cause CMT. \nMost of the CMT ne uropathies are demyelinating, especially CMT1A which comprises 60  to 65% of \ncases.  \n \nCMT4J is a rare autosomal recessive, peripheral motor demyelinating neuropathy caused by biallelic \npathogenic variants in the FIG4 gene. CMT4J is characterized by childhood  onset gait abnormalities \nand balance difficulties, that rapidly progress to muscle weakness and muscle atrophy during the teen \nor adult years. Onset can be acute or sub -acute, mimicking an acquired neuropathy and often \nmisdiagnosed as chronic inflammatory  demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), or a subacute \npresentation of Guillain -Barre Syndrome. Involvement can be asymmetric and can affect distal as well \nas proximal musculature. Although sensory symptoms are minimal, examination may reveal decreased \nrespon se to touch, pin prick, or vibration distally. Bulbar and cranial nerve functions are often spared; \nintellect is often normal.  \n \nThis study is designed to investigate the clinical characteristics and natural history of CMT4J. We aim \nto follow subjects with a molecularly confirmed diagnosis of CMT4J longitudinally to collect \nstandardized clinical data to evaluate epidemiological characteristics, clinical course, and to identify \npotential outcome measures which may be used in future clinical trials. Clinical d ata collection will \ninclude medical history and physical exam, hematology and biochemical analyses, calf muscle imaging, \nnerve conduction studies, pulmonary function testing and neuropsychological assessments.  \n \nThe study will be conducted in accordance wit h the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and the \napplicable regulatory requirements.  \n \n1.2 Background and Rationale  \n \nThere is no causative treatment available for CMT, but therapeutic clinical trials for the most common \ntypes of CMT, like CMT1A, are ongoin g. Most recently, animal models have demonstrated the \npossibility of treating some types of CMT, like CMT4J, with gene transfer therapy through viral \nvectors. To be able to understand the condition over time and evaluate these therapies at long term, \nnatur al history studies are indispensable. This study investigates the natural history of CMT4J.  \n \n1.3 Concise Summary of Project  \n \nThis is a multicenter, longitudinal, prospective observational natural history study of subjects with a \nmolecularly confirmed diagnosis of CMT4J. We plan to enroll 20 subjects of any age into a uniform \nprotocol for follow -up and evaluations. We will obtain  demographic and medical history information. \nNatural history data will be collected prospectively on an annual basis and may include \nphysical\/neurological exams, standard laboratory tests, CMT outcome and disability measures, \nneuropsychological tests, ner ve conduction studies (NCS), and imaging studies (muscle MRI). \nPulmonary function test (PFT) and scoliosis series x -ray Subject visits will occur every 12 months\n\nSOURCE: A Prospective Natural History and Outcome Measure Discovery Study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 4J.pdf",

The gender, race, and ethnic distribution of the \naccrued study population may not be representative of  the general population but is expected to reflect \nthose affected with the disease under study. Patients who currently seek medical care at a study site \nmay be approached to participate in the study. For those patients who are followed at a study site, the ir \ntreating physician will inform the patient and\/or family of the study. Should the patient\/family be \namenable to learning more about the study, then a member of the research staff will speak with them \nabout study participation. The patient\/family will be  given ample time to review the consent form and \nask questions. The patient may enroll into the study at any time during their care.  \n \nParticipants will be recruited through clinician or self -referral. The study will be posted at \nclinicaltrials.gov to aid r ecruitment. An IRB -approved study advertisement will also be made available \nto patient and professional organizations such as Cure CMT4J and the Inherited Neuropathies \nConsortium, respectively. The approved advertisement may be posted on patient organizati on \nwebsites\/social media accounts and may also be made available at scientific\/medical\/patient \nconferences.  \n  \nParticipant selection will be equitable considering the rarity of CMT4J. All ages within the specified \nrange, races, and both sexes will be accept ed. There will be no restriction based on geographic location. \nThe study team will enhance retention by sending email reminders to participants prior to scheduled \nvisits and will be available to answer any study -related questions between visits.  \n \nIf a pati ent\/family contacts the study personnel, they will send a consent form to the patient\/family and \nanswer their questions accordingly. If the patient\/family is interested in establishing care at a study site, \nthe study staff will connect them with the proper  department.  \n \n2.4 Consenting Process and Review of Genetic Diagnosis  \n \nDocumentation of genetic confirmation will be reviewed by the Investigator prior to any on -site visits \nbeing arranged, in order to confirm eligibility. Each site will follow their IRB guidelines on consent \nprocesses for obtaining genetic test results prior to on -site patient visits.  \n \nThe Sponsor is using a vendor to manage travel planning and expenses for the site and subjects. The \nvendor will act as a third -party working with both the site and subject to book travel (including flights, \nhotels, ground transportation, etc.) The vendor will bill the Sponsor directly for subject travel costs,\n\nSOURCE: A Prospective Natural History and Outcome Measure Discovery Study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 4J.pdf",

This evaluation was done through in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) assays using melanoma extracts and their respective controls.

First, immunization is hindered in patients due to the state of immunosuppression that many experience due to tumor burden, chemotherapy (81,82), or other as-yet-undetermined factors.

Another difficulty to be considered is the ability of tumors to evade immune system recognition (83).

            "Theoretical Formulation of the Project Melanoma is a malignant tumor of neuroectodermal origin whose incidence has progressively increased in the last century. The only way to cure a malignant melanoma is early detection and appropriate surgical treatment, as once it reaches an advanced state, it is highly resistant to conventional treatments such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy (1-3). Globally, melanoma is the fastest-growing and most deadly type of skin cancer in Europe and the United States among various cutaneous cancer types. This situation is also observed in Chile; only in Santiago, between 1992 and 1996, 318 malignant melanoma cases were detected, representing 10.6% of all types of skin cancer (1). While it is true that malignant melanoma is almost entirely curable (>95%) when detected early, the survival probability in patients with metastatic melanoma decreases significantly (<15%). Although surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy are the primary conventional methods for treating this disease, implementing new therapies is essential, especially in patients with stage III and IV melanoma, where chemotherapy and radiotherapy are ineffective.  Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death, especially among residents of highly developed countries. Modern surgical techniques and transplants, new and more effective drugs, and improved irradiation methods have allowed promising results in treating some diseases. A clear example of this progress is reflected in the treatment of childhood leukemia with a new generation of anti-cancer drugs (2). Often, some malignant cells survive these therapies and spread throughout the body, necessitating the development of new treatments as alternatives or complements to current ones. One such approach is manipulating the immune system to combat tumors, known as cancer immunotherapy. Since the 1980s, when cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) with antitumor activity were isolated from peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and tumor tissue of melanoma patients, there has been growing interest in using the immune system in cancer treatment. Cytokines such as Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and Interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) are commonly used as alternative therapies (4,5) in some neoplasms, and adoptive therapies, using in vitro stimulated CTL, have been tested in some clinical protocols with varying responses (6).  Over the last thirty years, significant progress has been made in understanding the functioning of the immune system, especially regarding antigen recognition (3,7). On the other hand, the significant advances in molecular biology techniques that facilitate gene cloning and the production of recombinant proteins have allowed for identifying tumor-associated antigens (AAT) and their subsequent characterization.  Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes and Antitumor Immune Response Historically, pioneering experiments demonstrated that the growth of syngeneic tumors in mice could be prevented through prior immunization with the same tumor (8,9). Guided by these studies in animal models, it has been observed that human T lymphocytes have also shown the ability to lyse autologous tumors in vitro (10,11) specifically. Furthermore, T cells are capable of proliferating in response to stimulation with autologous tumor cells, secreting cytokines such as IL-2, interferon-gamma (IFN-\u03b3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) (12). Antitumor T cells can be expanded in large quantities in vitro and adoptively transferred to treat significant tumor burdens in mice and humans (6). These observations have enabled the identification of tumor antigens recognized by human autologous T cells using molecular cloning techniques (13,14). These results provide undeniable evidence of a T cell-mediated response against autologous tumors. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs, CD8+) can recognize tumors through 8-10 amino acid peptide fragments derived from cytoplasmic or nuclear proteins associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I (15). Melanoma-specific CTLs, either adoptively transferred or activated in vivo by melanoma-associated antigen epitopes, have therapeutic potential, capable of inducing the regression of tumors and their micrometastases (16,17).  Melanoma-Associated Antigens Over the past five years, several melanoma-associated antigens (MAAs) recognized by CTLs have been identified, and their peptide epitopes are characterized using genetic (13,14) and biochemical methods (18).\n\nSOURCE: PHASE II STUDY OF IMMUNIZATION WITH DENDRITIC CELLS AND LOW DOSE OF INTERLEUKIN-2, IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED MELANOMA.pdf",

            "Cancer continues to be one of the leading causes of death, especially among inhabitants of highly developed countries. Modern surgical and transplant techniques, new and more effective drugs, and improved radiation methods have yielded promising results in treating some of these conditions. However, some malignant cells often survive these therapies and spread throughout the body, necessitating the development of new treatments as an alternative or complement to current ones. One such approach would be manipulating the immune system to combat tumors, known as cancer immunotherapy. The use of modified immune system cells for oncological treatment, such as dendritic cells (DCs), is well-documented by international studies that have tested and are exploring various clinical protocols.  Over the past five years, accumulated evidence has demonstrated that modified dendritic cell vaccines produce significant clinical and immunological responses in diseases such as malignant melanoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and other neoplasms in stages of the disease where no practical alternative therapy exists.  On the other hand, experimental therapies based on Interleukin-2 (IL-2) have been used with relative success in some neoplasms since 1985. However, problems related to the toxicity of IL-2 are still under investigation. Although recombinant human IL-2 like PROLEUKIN has proven to be one of the most effective strategies in treating advanced renal carcinoma and melanoma, therapy based on high-dose intravenous IL-2 is not suitable for all patients. Our direct experience, based on clinical studies conducted at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and international experience with PROLEUKIN, indicates that low doses (2.4x106 IU\/m2) administered subcutaneously maintain the same beneficial effects for patients while almost wholly eliminating adverse effects. Therefore, we have decided to present to the respective committee a second protocol, leveraging the experience gained and the recent funding obtained from FONDEF, to develop an optimized protocol that alternates dendritic cell vaccines with the use of low doses of IL-2 as a complement to strengthen the immune system.  For some time now, we have established a multidisciplinary group of professionals at the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Chile, involving the participation of preclinical and clinical researchers. We have recently completed a phase I clinical protocol for treating malignant melanoma using DCs loaded with tumor extracts. This study, the first of its kind in Chile and probably in Latin America, serves as the basis for the presentation of this project.  The results can be summarized as follows: No adverse effects were observed from the subcutaneous application of dendritic cells, except for one patient who showed mild fever and arthralgia. Immunological effects were observed in vitro in 60% of the treated patients through an increase in specific T lymphocyte precursors against tumor cells in the patient's blood measured by ELISPOT, in addition to delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions (DTH) in 50% of the treated patients when tumor extract was injected subcutaneously after vaccinations. Finally, partial regression or mixed response was observed in two patients. One showed regression of lung metastases, and the other showed regression of cutaneous metastases. In most cases, disease stability was observed, although it cannot be concluded that a significant relationship exists between vaccination and the survival of treated patients. These results motivate further exploration of the methodology, primarily intending to provide therapeutic alternatives to patients with no other options.\n\nSOURCE: PHASE II STUDY OF IMMUNIZATION WITH DENDRITIC CELLS AND LOW DOSE OF INTERLEUKIN-2, IN PATIENTS WITH ADVANCED MELANOMA.pdf",

OBJECTIVES,  SPECIFIC  AIMS,  BACKGROUND,  AND  SIGNIFICANCE  \n \nObjective:  To assess  the effect  of postprandial  ambulation  on birth  weight  in patients  with gestational  \ndiabetes  as compared  to routine  activity.  \n \nBackground\/Introduction:  \nGestational  Diabetes  Mellitus  (GDM)  affects 6-8% of pregnancies  in the United  States (1). Patients  who \nare diagnosed  with GDM  are unable  to maintain  euglycemia  due to insulin  resistance,  particularly  \npostprandially (2). This postprandial  hyperglycemia  has been  tied to numerous  clinical  outcomes  including  \nincreased  risk for hypertensive  disorders,  cesarean  delivery,  shoulder  dystocia,  increased  birth weight  and \nlarge  for gestational  age (LGA)  neonates (2). The initial  treatment  of GDM  includes  lifestyle  changes  \nincluding  daily  exercise  and adoption  of the American  Diabetes  Association  (ADA)  diet(3). Exercise  has \nbeen  shown  to improve  glucose  levels  in patients  with gestational  diabetes (4, 5). However  an optimal  \nexercise  regimen  has yet to be established.  As elevated  postprandial  glucose  levels  have  been  associated  \nwith increasing  birthweight,  it may be inferred  that an intervention  aimed  to decrease  postprandial  \nglucose  may assist  in carbohydrate  metabolism  and thus decrease  the percentage  of large  for gestational  \nage neonates.  \n \nA prior  small  pilot study  done  in Denmark  assessed  glucose  trends  in patients  who exercised  for 20 \nminutes  after each meal  and showed  a significant  decrease  in postprandial  glucose.  As walking  is a safe, \nlow-impact  exercise  that requires  no equipment  and can be done  outside  or inside,  this would  be an \nintervention  that is accessible  to almost  all patients.  At Women  and Infants  Hospital  in the Division  of \nMaternal  Fetal  Medicine  we care for a large  volume  of patients  with gestational  diabetes  and are well \npoised  to assess  how a simple  intervention  such as postprandial  ambulation  can impact  maternal  and \nneonatal  outcomes.   \n \nHypothesis:  We hypo thesize  that postprandial  ambulation  in patients  with gestational  diabetes  will be \nassociated  with a decrease  in neonatal  birth  percentile  as compared  to patients  who do not ambulate  \npostprandially.    \n \n2.

We will also collect time of \nsymptoms onset (e.g. , motor, language, etc.) and progression, age at diagnosis and genetic results.  \n \nPhysical and Neurological Examination : At each visit, a physical exam will be recorded including  but \nnot limited to evaluation of the ears, nose, throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, back, and extremities, motor \nand sensory, and vital signs which will include blood pressure (measured in one arm or, if necessary, \none leg, after the subject has been seated f or approximately 5 minutes), pulse, temperature, height, \nweight, and head circumference.  \n \nA detailed neurological examination including but not limited to evaluation of cranial nerves, muscle \ntone, muscle strength, sensation, gait, coordination and deep te ndon reflex testing will also be \nperformed. Handheld dynamometry will also be performed during clinic visits in muscles of the upper \nand lower extremities. The examination is anticipated to take approximately 30 minutes.  \n \n3.1 Outcome Measures  \nCMT  Pediatric Sca le (CMT PedS ): The CMTPedS is a clinical tool used to supplement a neurological \nexamination and capture functionally relevant limitations caused by CMT in the pediatric population. \nIt is intended to have broad application in natural history studies and clin ical trials of rehabilitative \n(e.g., orthoses, stretching, strengthening), pharmacological (e.g. , curcumin, anti -progesterone) and \nsurgical (e.g. , foot and hand tendon transfer, arthrodesis, hip dysplasia) interventions (3). This scale \nwill be used for sub jects aged 5 to 17 years 11 months (less than 18 years).  \n \nCMT Infant Scale (CMTInfS) : The CMTInfS is a validated clinical tool and r equires 20 min to \nadminister and is a reliable and sensitive 15 -item functional outcome measure for early onset CMT and \nrelated neuropathies. The CMTInfS can be implemented in natural history studies to understand the \nrate of progression at the earliest stages of disease in preparation for therapeutic trials of early \ninterventions . The CMTPedS involves some difficult items that require advanced levels of \ncomprehension, so high variability is seen in children <4 years of age. Therefore, for children aged 3 \nyears, the CMTInfS may be more sensitive to disease severity and clinical impression.  \n \nCMT  Neuropathy Score, second versi on (CMT NSv2 ): The CMTNSv2 is a validated clinical outcome \nmeasure developed for use in clinical trials to monitor disease impairment, severity and progression in \naffected CMT subjects (4). This scale will be used for subjects 18 years of age or older.  \n \nCMT  Functional Outcome Measure (CMT -FOM ): The CMT -FOM is a performance -based outcome \nassessment which measures limitations in functional abilities in adults with CMT1A  (5). It was based \non the validated CMTPedS and further developed using review of the litera ture, patient interviews and \na survey of 407 adults with CMT, and subjects 18 years of age or older.  \n \nCMT Health Index (CMTHI) : The CMTHI is a disease -specific, patient reported outcome measure \ndesigned to capture the disease burden of inherited neuropathies, in the context of a clinical trial (6). \nThis scale will be used for subjects 18 years of age or older.  \n \nVineland Adaptive Behavior Scale, 3rd Edition : The caregiver interview form will be used to evaluate \ncommunication, socialization, and dai ly living skills of subjects to assess their overall adaptive\n\nSOURCE: A Prospective Natural History and Outcome Measure Discovery Study of Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease, Type 4J.pdf",

OBJECTIVES,  SPECIFIC  AIMS,  BACKGROUND,  AND  SIGNIFICANCE  \n \nObjective:  To assess  the effect  of postprandial  ambulation  on birth  weight  in patients  with gestational  \ndiabetes  as compared  to routine  activity.  \n \nBackground\/Introduction:  \nGestational  Diabetes  Mellitus  (GDM)  affects 6-8% of pregnancies  in the United  States (1). Patients  who \nare diagnosed  with GDM  are unable  to maintain  euglycemia  due to insulin  resistance,  particularly  \npostprandially (2). This postprandial  hyperglycemia  has been  tied to numerous  clinical  outcomes  including  \nincreased  risk for hypertensive  disorders,  cesarean  delivery,  shoulder  dystocia,  increased  birth weight  and \nlarge  for gestational  age (LGA)  neonates (2). The initial  treatment  of GDM  includes  lifestyle  changes  \nincluding  daily  exercise  and adoption  of the American  Diabetes  Association  (ADA)  diet(3). Exercise  has \nbeen  shown  to improve  glucose  levels  in patients  with gestational  diabetes (4, 5). However  an optimal  \nexercise  regimen  has yet to be established.  As elevated  postprandial  glucose  levels  have  been  associated  \nwith increasing  birthweight,  it may be inferred  that an intervention  aimed  to decrease  postprandial  \nglucose  may assist  in carbohydrate  metabolism  and thus decrease  the percentage  of large  for gestational  \nage neonates.  \n \nA prior  small  pilot study  done  in Denmark  assessed  glucose  trends  in patients  who exercised  for 20 \nminutes  after each meal  and showed  a significant  decrease  in postprandial  glucose.  As walking  is a safe, \nlow-impact  exercise  that requires  no equipment  and can be done  outside  or inside,  this would  be an \nintervention  that is accessible  to almost  all patients.  At Women  and Infants  Hospital  in the Division  of \nMaternal  Fetal  Medicine  we care for a large  volume  of patients  with gestational  diabetes  and are well \npoised  to assess  how a simple  intervention  such as postprandial  ambulation  can impact  maternal  and \nneonatal  outcomes.   \n \nHypothesis:  We hypo thesize  that postprandial  ambulation  in patients  with gestational  diabetes  will be \nassociated  with a decrease  in neonatal  birth  percentile  as compared  to patients  who do not ambulate  \npostprandially.    \n \n2.

            "Protocol\/V 3\/161023 \nIRAS 327246  10 Solutions are required to improve timely patient access to surgery. The approach will need \nto be multi -factorial, and increasing day -case rates by configuring safe and effective \npathways is one proposed method (2). Performing common endourology operations as a \nday-case when possible, could take pressure off inpatient resources and allow these \ninpatient beds to be used for other purposes (3). It also means that these endourology \noperations could proceed without a reliance on inpatient bed availability, and this would \nopen opportunities to perform surgery in peripheral day -case units without inpatient beds \n(4). Furthermore, by utilising less resource intensive day -case pathways there would be cost \nsavings, and potentially reduced associated greenhouse gas emissions (5). There is \nadditionally reason to suppose that patients might have a superior experience by recovering \nat home instead of as a hospital inpatient, although this has not yet been demonstrated in \nacademic literature.  \n \nThe Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) programme is an expert clinician -led a nd data -driven \nnational quality improvement programme aiming to improve standards and decrease \nunwarranted variation in clinical care (6). Separate GIRFT workstreams exist for each \nmedical and surgical specialty. The GIRFT urology programme advocates for increased day -\ncase rates for common endourology operations and recommends a \u201cday -case by default\u201d \napproach to TURBT. The GIRFT programme r ecommend ed day-case adoption in the 2018 \nGIRFT Urology National Report and their GIRFT academy service delivery guides (7)(8)(9). At \nthe intensive deep dive visits that GIRFT perform to every single urology unit in England, \nday-case pathways are commonly discussed as a target  for quality improvement. In the five \nyears since the 2018 report, trends towards increasing day -case rates have been observed, \nhowever there remains significant nationwide variation in the rates of day -case surgery \nperformed for TURBT, and bladder outflow obstruction operations such as TURP  and TUEP.  \n \nA fundamental question that remains  largely  unanswered is what the experience is like for \npatients who undergo day -case endourology operations. There is a common assumption \nthat patients would prefer to recover at home as part of a safe day -case pathway, however \nthis assumption is untested. This qu estion is particularly relevant for TURBT, TURP and TUEP \nbecause practice with respect to adoption of day -case surgery remains divergent across \nEngland. It is important to understand whether and how we can facilit ate an acceptable \npatient experience of day -case TURBT , TURP  and TUEP, so that our findings can inform \nfuture GIRFT recommendations around optimising day -case surgery pathways.  We intend to \nutilise a semi -structured qualitative interview  format  to explor e the patient experience of \nday case urology operations, and understand what contributes to a positive or negative \nexperience  (10). \nAims and Objectives  \nAim:\n\nSOURCE: Understanding the patient experience of day-case bladder tumour resection, and prostate resection or enucleation.pdf",
            "Protocol\/V 3\/161023 \nIRAS 327246  9 Plain English Summary  \nSafely performing day -case surgery is a way of easing  pressure on hospitals . This is because \nit avoid s an overnight stay. It allows patients to recover in their own home . This is likely to \nbe cheaper  and better for the environment because it uses less resource.  \n \nIn healthcare, urology deals with problems with the urinary and sex organs. Urology \nincludes some  common operations that can safely be performed as a day -case. These \ninclude  treating  bladder tumour s and removing  part or all of the prostate to treat a \nblockage . All of these involve treating the patient through their natural orifice (urethra) \ninstead of making any cuts to the skin.  \n \nIn England, the Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) programme suggests  that these \noperations should be performed as a day -case. Even  so, there is wide variation in day -case \nrates across  England . Most of these operations still involve an overnight hospital stay.  \n \nWe want  to know what it is like for patients who go home on the day of surgery. We hope \nthat this will tell us how to improve the process  for patients in future.  \n \nWe will perform the study through hospitals that do a lot of day -case surgery for bladder \ntumours or prostates. Before or after surgery the doctor will ask their patient if they would \nbe happy  to be interviewed . This would take place in the future after they have fully \nrecovered. Patients will be given an leaflet explaining the study .

This is particularly relevant given the intense pressures on hospital \nresources in the United Kingdom. Urological surgery includes a number of f requently \nperformed operations for which safe day -case surgery pathways have been demonstrated , \nbut for which day surgery is routine widespread routine practice . These include bladder \ntumour resection (TURBT), and prostate resection or enucleation using di athermy or laser \n(TURP and TUEP) . All of these operation types involve endoscopic access to the bladder via \nthe urethra, and do not involve skin incisions. They can be performed under general or \nspinal anaesthesia.  \n \nFor 12 months from December 2021, the national average day -case rate for transurethral \nresection of bladder tumour In England was 21.1%, and ranged from 0% to 87.3% at \ndifferent hospitals, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 10.5% to 37.7%, and 23,071 cas es \nperformed in total. For bladder outflow obstruction surgery the median day -case rate was \n7.7% (range 0% to 82.4%, IQR 4.4% to 19.1%, 18,912 cases), and this includes TURP and \nTUEP. This demonstrates that for these common operations there is significant variation in \npractice across England.  \n \nThe Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) Urology programme advocates for a \u201cday -case by \ndefault\u201d approach to TURBT, and that day -case surgery should ideally be offered for \nprostate resection and enucleation. As well as reducing pressure on inpatient service s, \ngreater day -case adoption offers to reduce financial costs, shorten waiting lists by allowing \ngreater access to day -case theatres away from the acute hospital, and reduce \nenvironmental impact by adopting a less resource -intensive approach. It also offer s a more \nstandardised patient experience , however we do not understand a great deal about the \nlived patient experience after discharge .  \n \nNational day -case rates for of TURBT , and bladder outflow obstruction surgery using TURP \nor TUEP,  have increased over the past five years . Many hospitals have well -established \npathways, whilst others are newly adopting this approach, or not yet adopting day -case \nsurgery for these operation types at all. There is an opportunity to understand the patient \nexperience of different day -case surge ry pathways for these operations of interest, so that \nwe might understand factors contributing to a favourable or unfav ourable experience. This \nknowledge could inform future day -case pathway development and modification is a way \nthat is more acceptable for patients.  \n \nTo explore this area , we intend to perform qualitative research involving patients . We will \ninterview patients who were treated at a  range of different hospitals with differing day -case \nperformances.\n\nSOURCE: Understanding the patient experience of day-case bladder tumour resection, and prostate resection or enucleation.pdf"

            "Protocol\/V 3\/161023 \nIRAS 327246  8 Scientific Summary  \nSafe day -case surgery pathways offer to reduce pressure on hospitals by avoiding overnight \ninpatient admission. This is particularly relevant given the intense pressures on hospital \nresources in the United Kingdom. Urological surgery includes a number of f requently \nperformed operations for which safe day -case surgery pathways have been demonstrated , \nbut for which day surgery is routine widespread routine practice . These include bladder \ntumour resection (TURBT), and prostate resection or enucleation using di athermy or laser \n(TURP and TUEP) . All of these operation types involve endoscopic access to the bladder via \nthe urethra, and do not involve skin incisions. They can be performed under general or \nspinal anaesthesia.  \n \nFor 12 months from December 2021, the national average day -case rate for transurethral \nresection of bladder tumour In England was 21.1%, and ranged from 0% to 87.3% at \ndifferent hospitals, with an interquartile range (IQR) of 10.5% to 37.7%, and 23,071 cas es \nperformed in total. For bladder outflow obstruction surgery the median day -case rate was \n7.7% (range 0% to 82.4%, IQR 4.4% to 19.1%, 18,912 cases), and this includes TURP and \nTUEP. This demonstrates that for these common operations there is significant variation in \npractice across England.  \n \nThe Getting It Right First Time (GIRFT) Urology programme advocates for a \u201cday -case by \ndefault\u201d approach to TURBT, and that day -case surgery should ideally be offered for \nprostate resection and enucleation. As well as reducing pressure on inpatient service s, \ngreater day -case adoption offers to reduce financial costs, shorten waiting lists by allowing \ngreater access to day -case theatres away from the acute hospital, and reduce \nenvironmental impact by adopting a less resource -intensive approach. It also offer s a more \nstandardised patient experience , however we do not understand a great deal about the \nlived patient experience after discharge .  \n \nNational day -case rates for of TURBT , and bladder outflow obstruction surgery using TURP \nor TUEP,  have increased over the past five years . Many hospitals have well -established \npathways, whilst others are newly adopting this approach, or not yet adopting day -case \nsurgery for these operation types at all. There is an opportunity to understand the patient \nexperience of different day -case surge ry pathways for these operations of interest, so that \nwe might understand factors contributing to a favourable or unfav ourable experience. This \nknowledge could inform future day -case pathway development and modification is a way \nthat is more acceptable for patients.  \n \nTo explore this area , we intend to perform qualitative research involving patients . We will \ninterview patients who were treated at a  range of different hospitals with differing day -case \nperformances.\n\nSOURCE: Understanding the patient experience of day-case bladder tumour resection, and prostate resection or enucleation.pdf"
