        "0":"Anterior open bite is defined as a condition where the upper incisor crowns fail to overlap the incisal third of the lower incisor crowns when the mandible is brought into full occlusion.

For example, if the malocclusion is due to a habit like thumb sucking, the upper incisor teeth may be proclined, resulting in a V-shaped upper arch. Additionally, increased buccal pressure during sucking can lead to a narrowing of the arch in the molar region.",

        "1":"The shape of the maxillary arch can exhibit characteristic features depending on the cause of the anterior open bite. For example, if the malocclusion is due to habits like thumb sucking or foreign objects between teeth, distinct arch shapes such as V-shaped or localized open bites may occur.",
        "2":"Conventional treatments include the use of bite blocks, high-pull headgear, new facemask designs, fixed mechanics, multiloop edgewise archwires, extraction therapy, intermaxillary vertical elastics, and inhibition of molar eruption during growth.",
        "3":"The effectiveness of the treatment will be evaluated through a comprehensive set of assessments, including panoramic and cephalometric X-rays, upper and lower orthodontic casts, extraoral and intraoral photographs. Specifically, cephalometric analysis will be conducted before and after treatment to measure parameters such as ANB angle, anterior and posterior facial heights, upper incisor inclination, and the relationship of these structures to reference lines like SN line and FH line. Additionally, smile analysis will be performed post-correction to assess the aesthetic outcomes of the treatment."
